Add Font Awesome Icons to all of our Buttons
Font Awesome is a convenient library of icons. These icons can be web fonts or vector graphics. These icons are treated just like fonts. You can specify their size using pixels, and they will assume the font size of their parent HTML elements.

Use Font Awesome to add an info-circle icon to your info button and a trash icon to your delete button.

Note: You can use either i or span elements to complete this challenge.
